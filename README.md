This serves as a project for the course "Mobile Robotics" EE-468 offered at Habib University.

To run the files above, WeBots version 2020b should be installed. As a corollary of this, python version installed should be 2.6, and be included in path variables.

This project is a simulation of underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The environment is based on a rectangular tank filled with water and two landmarks sub-merged (a wooden box and a rock). The algorithm implemented is that of an Obstacle-Avoidance robot. The purpose of this project was to explore the possible options to simulate underwater ROVs. To do this, the aim was to implement just one algorithm studied over the course duration in an underwater setting. Because the work done already in this is severely lacking in terms of simulating algorithms on simulators, performing this process itself would generate valuable insights into how this can be done.

The robot model was taken from the online Github repository linked below:
